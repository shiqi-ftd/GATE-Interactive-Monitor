# GATE-Interactive-Monitor
This is a web interface project named GATE Interactive Monitor which is based on GATE platform, EduGATE project and ROOT.

The aim of this project is to provide basic simulation templates and easy access to the end user through web interface. There are multiple simulations to choose from including Cylindrical PET, Gamma Camera, etc. 
The key features of using this interface includes:

Light weight: 
Given the central-server's interface, there's no need to install the whole system on local devices.


Portable: 
The end user could control and monitor the simulation everywhere at anytime if there is a Internet access.

Easy and Fast to set up: 
Given the simulation templates, it is much easier and quicker for the end to set up the simulation environment.


Detailed: 
Within each simulation template, the end user remains the freedom of setting up multiple parameters.
